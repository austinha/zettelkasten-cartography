As argonsnorts articulates, [[The "Binary Tree Problem" in Luhmann's Zettelkasten]] isn't actually an issue that existed because the links were arbitrary and inconsistent. For example (edited for visual clarity): 
> To illustrate the problem, a simple list of Luhmann-ID'd notes like the following could be internally related in a whole host of ways:
> 
> `{2,2,a,1}`
>   `{2,2,a,1,a}`
>   `{2,2,a,1,b}`
>   `{2,2,a,1,c}`
>   ...  
>   `{2,2,a,1,z}`
>   `{{2,2,a,1,aa`
>   `{{2,2,a,1,bb}`
> `{2,2,a,2}`
> `{2,2,a,3}`
> `{2,2,a,4}`
> ...  
> `{2,2a,1,987}`
> 
> Each of the notes under {2,2,a,1} could be direct follow-ups to it. Or, for example, {2,2,a,1,b} could be a direct follow-up to {2,2,a,1,a}, and {2,2,a,3} could be a direct follow-up to {2,2,a,2}.[^1]

> This was an issue for Luhmann too, and he wasn't consistent in how he branched from one note to two or three follow-ups. Sometimes {2,2,a,1,b} followed {2,2,a,1,a}, sometimes it followed {2,2,a,1}. You could only tell by looking at the notes and seeing how they connect internally.[^1]
