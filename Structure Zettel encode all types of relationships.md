Structure notes allow you to encode many kinds of relationships by enabling **annotation**. From @mrsteffens:
> structure notes allow to encode all kinds of relationship. You can have multiple structure notes to indicate different relationships. To clarify the relationships, one can add subheadings & comments, use lists for hierarchical structure or even nest more structure notes. IMO, this is truly flexible.[^1]
