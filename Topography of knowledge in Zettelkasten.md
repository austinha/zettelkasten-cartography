There is tons of talk about the "topography"[^1][^2][^7] of zettelkasten throughout the forums. I love this term, and at the beginning of this post, I want to call for help crystallizing a definition for what we mean when we talk about topography. My definition:

**Topography of a Zettelkasten** ::- the arrangement of connections that exist in an archive. 

I would expand on this to say that the Topography of a Zettelkasten mirrors the Topography of all possible connections within a Zettelkasten. In other words, the connections that are in our Zettelkasten are a selection of all the possible connections that could exist (which seems trivial to state). Our practical, real Zettelkasten is an image of this "Maximal" slip box with all possible connections, but not an exact image â€“ in fact, an exact image would not be useful to us...knowing that every note can be connected to every other note for _some_ reason would not be useful in practicality.

**Topography of Knowledge in a Zettelkasten** ::- the arragement of connections that exist in a "Maximal" archive.
