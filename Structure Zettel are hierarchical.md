@sfast notes:
> Direkt links need to be intentional and the connection needs to be made explicit. Structure Zettel need hierarchical order to make sense.[^1]

@argonsnorts agrees to an extent, saying that Structure Zettel work when connections are obvious:
> In some cases, Structure Notes work very well, either because one already understands the nature of the relationship between two (or more) notes, or because the nature of the relationship between two notes is clear. The latter is the case when notes are related hierarchicallyâ€”when note 2 is an example of what is described in note 1.[^2]
