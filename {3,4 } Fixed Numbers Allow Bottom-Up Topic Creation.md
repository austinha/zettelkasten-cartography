While thoughts can be traversed linearly from some root to some leaf in a Zettelkasten, topics can be created in real-time through the placement of a new note. Abstractly, this happens when we begin with some new note that contains a specific thought. Then, through [[{2,1 } Comparative Filing]], we traverse "up" the tree to some root, where we can then insert another note that describes the topic our original note belongs in. This creation of supporting notes can be done any number of times between the newly-created leaf and the "base" of the tree structure, where the topic at hand is very high level.
