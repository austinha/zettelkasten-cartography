If you use Folgezettel, when filing a new note, you _must_ find a place to file it before storing it in your archive:
> with Luhmann-IDs, finding a note to link to is a prerequisite of adding a new note to the Zettelkasten (or, if there is no relevant note, determining that there is no relevant note to link to is a prerequisite). With date-IDs, that's not the case.[^1]

> I am forced to make up my mind, where to put the Zettel. Which in turn clarifies the boundaries of the Zettel contents-wise. It becomes clear very fast, when a Zettel is finished.[^2]
