Many discussions[^1][^2][^4] compare Folgezettel to an outline. Sascha notes something a little more precise: that Folgezettel "assign each Zettel a place in a hierarchy"[^3]. 

Luhmann, however, hoped to solve the problem of multiple storage by "captur\[ing\] connections radially"[^5] – something that was limited by the physicality of his box[^6].
