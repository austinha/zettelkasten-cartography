Famously, Luhmann's Zettelkasten was an early example of hypertext: text that allowed traversal between documents. Luhmann himself noted this hypertextual nature enabled by a static ID system[^1]:
> Since all papers have fixed numbers, you can add as many references to them as you may want. Central concepts can have many links which show on which other contexts we can find materials relevant for them. Through references, we can, without too work or paper, solve the problem of multiple storage. Given this technique, it is less important where we place a new note. If there are several possibilities, we can solve the problem as we wish and just record the connection by a link \[or reference\]. Often the context in which we are working suggests a multiplicity of links to other notes.
