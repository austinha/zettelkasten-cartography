@argonsnorts: 
> Luhmann IDs themselves establish (in the sense of indicate) the existence of a relationship, whereas date/time IDs themselves indicate no such thing. When you use date/time IDs, relationships between notes have to be described through some other means --- like an outline, or a graphic visualization, or a structure note.[^1]

> Yes, you can use direct links in notes to relate one note to another, but as I have described elsewhere, this relationship is encoded only in the note itself. When using Luhmann numbers, the relationship gets encoded (non-semantically) in the title and therefore in the index. When using Structure Notes, one has to work to understand and be able to articulate the nature of the relationship between the notes prior to its inclusion in a structure (web of relations) that is indicated somewhere outside of itself.[^2]

@MikeBraddock agrees (he actually notes it _earlier_):
> The physical appearance of UID doesn't suggest much about the connections between zettels other then a direct connection exists.

> The Luhmann style numbering does. I think that is a distinction worth noting.[^3]

@alkhan notes that Luhmann IDs make it easier to "surf" your Zettelkasten:
> the moment I stopped thinking about note sequences as hierarchies[^5], it became easier to visualize the flow of connections; I didn't have to go through each note to see all connections inside my collection.[^4]

It's possible that this is useful because you embed a note in a particular context:
> When I make a Luhmann number it connects one note to another note. Easy. That's the focus. Just link to one note[^6].   
> But it also produces a lot of implicit relationships to other notes. Whether these relationships will be relevant or not is up to me to work out later, but what the Luhmann number provides is added context to the note in a systematic way so that it is never lost.[^7]
