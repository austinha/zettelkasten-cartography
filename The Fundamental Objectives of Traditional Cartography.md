The fundamental objectives of traditional cartography are to:
- Set the map's agenda and **select traits of the object to be mapped**. This is the concern of **map editing**. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as toponyms or political boundaries.
- **Eliminate characteristics of the mapped object that are not relevant** to the map's purpose. This is the concern of **generalization**.
    -  **Reduce the complexity of the characteristics that will be mapped.** This is also the concern of **generalization**.
- **Orchestrate the elements** of the map **to best convey its message** to its audience. This is the concern of **map design**.
    - Represent the **terrain of the mapped object on flat media**. This is the concern of **map projections**.
