Thomas[^1] suggests that we should utilize special notes as [[{1,2,0 } Folgezettel (pkm)]] in a digital Zettelkasten[^2]. She goes on to suggest that we add a link to each sequence the note belongs to _on each note_[^1], but this is unnecessary in software that automatically generates backlinks!

The reason we can use Structure Notes to replace Folgezettel is because "both Folgezettel and Structure Zettel are means to remove meaning from position in a hierarchy"[^3].
