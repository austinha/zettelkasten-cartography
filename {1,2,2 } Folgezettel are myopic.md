Folgezettel, in Luhmann's archive, were only related to the single previous note[^1][^2] â€“ in this way, they were highly myopic.

> The only criterion where to put a new Zettel: Connection to the previous Zettel. A Zettel should have some connection to the previous Zettel. The result: Some topics are spread out to different places.[^2]

> After seeing that, I reviewed how the Folgezettel worked, and then finally understood that it actually meant a direct, obvious connection between notes.[^3]

> When I make a Luhmann number it connects one note to another note. Easy. That's the focus. Just link to one note.[^4]

It's possible that [[{1,1,2 } Folgezettel are not hierarchy]] because they are myopic.
