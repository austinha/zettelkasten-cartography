> Yes, you can use direct links in notes to relate one note to another, but as I have described elsewhere, this relationship is encoded only in the note itself. When using Luhmann numbers, the relationship gets encoded (non-semantically) in the title and therefore in the index. When using Structure Notes, one has to work to understand and be able to articulate the nature of the relationship between the notes prior to its inclusion in a structure (web of relations) that is indicated somewhere outside of itself.

The latter is the case when notes are related hierarchically—when note 2 is an example of what is described in note 1.

@pseudovagrius immediately agrees:
> The structure note front loads this cognitive task or skips it by operating on assumptions or on conclusions from other work/notes as opposed to the ones internal to the structure note. Of course, you can let the internal structure of the notes change as you process them further and add new notes, but this can get untenable quick depending on how many notes you are dealing with.[^2]
