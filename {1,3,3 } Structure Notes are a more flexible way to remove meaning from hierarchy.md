[[{1,2,0 } Folgezettel (pkm)]] remove meaning from hierarchy across the entirety of a Zettelkasten[^2]. They accomplish this by establishing a hierarchy that spans the entirety of the Zettelkasten[^1]. That said, Structure Notes don't inherently create hierarchy across the entire Zettelkasten – they can be siloed from one another. Sascha notes, however, that: 
> If we want a hierarchy that covers all of our Zettelkasten we’d just create a Master Structure Zettel. By implementing Luhmann’s Folgezettel technique, you create an enumerated, nested list. Nothing more and nothing less. It can be done by assigning each Zettel the Luhmann Identifier, and it can be done by creating a master Structure Zettel.[^1]

> Structure Zettel on the other hand do not introduce one single hierarchy but the possibility of indefinite hierarchies.[^1]

The creation of these "indefinite hierarchies" is what eases the burden here: a single, atomic note doesn't have to be placed in a single hierarchy, thereby allowing you to branch radially[^3].
