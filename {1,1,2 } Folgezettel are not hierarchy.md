Sascha notes that "Folgezettel does not mean hierarchy"[^1], which seems to refute Thomas' claim[^2] that Folgezettel is a nested sequence of ideas.

However, Sascha elaborates to say that hierarchy _is_ created with Folgezettel, but that hierarchy is "arbitrary and therefore meaningless"[^3] in Luhmann's implementation.

See: [[{1,2,2,2} The myopic nature of Folgezettel make connections less meaningful]]
