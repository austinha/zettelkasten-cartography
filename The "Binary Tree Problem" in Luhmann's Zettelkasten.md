There is a claim that Luhmann's branching technique only allowed two children. As articulated by ctietze:

> First time, you can follow up on `{2,2,a,1}` with `{2,2,a,2}`, the next in the (sibling) chain.
> 
> Second time, the rest of the sibling chain has grown from `{2,2,a,2}` to `{2,2,a,986}`, and you want to add something "close" to `{2,2,a,1}` again. Well, you can still intersperse a thought between `{2,2,a,1}` and `{2,2,a,2}` by branching off and create `{2,2,a,1,a}`. In some way, both `{2,2,a,1,a}` and `{2,2,a,2}` are both one step away: the former is a step down, the latter a step sideways.
> 
> But what about the third time you want to put an insight close? You cannot branch off into another dimension with this notation; there are only siblings and children in the tree of Folgezettel-IDs, aka 2 directions to grow, not three[^1]
