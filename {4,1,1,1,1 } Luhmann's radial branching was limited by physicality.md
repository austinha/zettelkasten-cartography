Thomas[^1] clearly articulates what Luhmann discusses in his paper on his slip-box: when placing a note in the box, you are limited by the physicality _of the box_. 

Luhmann hoped that he could solve the problem of "multiple storage," as he put it, by leaving references on a new note to all of the relevant places in the slip box it _could have gone_, and immediately leaving backlinks in each of those locations to the newly-added note. He wanted to be able to surf his knowledge by leaving these breadcrumbs, but he was forced to pirivlege a single, linear, physical location over the other (indirect) locations.

Whereas a linear storage model allowed workarounds to "branch radially," the reality is that the most natural branching method was linear as well. By constrast, we are able to "radially" branch using modern technology by maintaining lists of links that serve as lines of thought.

> If we are not able to see all these linked notes at a glance, we will be biased towards the closer one, although it might not be the most relevant.[^1]
