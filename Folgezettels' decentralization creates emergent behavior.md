from @argonsnorts:
> it's brought me the ability to see where clusters are forming, independent of my intentionally setting out to form them. For example, it turns out I have a lot of notes that begin with the sequence "{2,5,c", many (but not all) of which circle around a general topic (historical attitudes about and approaches to empiricism). I didn't set out to create a cluster on that topic, it just emerged as a result of my reading and note-taking.[^1]
