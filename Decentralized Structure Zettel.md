> Decentralized views, virtual views, just in time views, can exist as well. We have these now with UID links, tags, save searches, save search links. These are all networks with nodes as well, but they lack sequencing, order, and provide only weak context (options may vary about this weakness). Sometimes although a view is fun, cool, exciting, they can also not be beneficial.

> Folgezettels and folgechains are or can be decentralized nodes of outlines, nonlinear networks, hierarchal networks, or any network. For them to be useful, we have to gather them together with their sequencing into a helpful view. What @argonsnorts and @pseudoevagrius have done is shown us a way to do this using KB Maestro macro and a Hazel macro. At this time, The Archive doesn't provide an automated way to centralize these nodes into a meaningful virtual dynamic view. Including the Folgezettel node id in the title, then using the Omnibar to search the folgechains and walk up and down the chain is as close as we come as of today. But that lacks the sequencing of the nodes to completely useful.
