> After a couple of years with this technique, it evolved quite naturally as I realized what I was actually doing. I gradually enriched those “overview notes” with meaning. I wrote my intentions and goals on top. I added structure to what were merely lists, separated by headings. I wrote texts on them and refactored them into separate Zettel, leaving breadcrumbs to the extracted Zettel where they originated from.[^1]

taking a look at these best practices, it’s important to determine their pros and cons. for example, does writing a purpose at the top of a Structure Note limit your ability to explore new lines of thought?
