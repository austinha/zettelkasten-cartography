Thomas notes that structure notes work remarkably well as Folgezettel:
> We are not constructing Folgezettels inside the slip-box as an outline for our writing, although we can use them for that purpose as well. Everything that is in the slip-box is abstracted from any project type of organization...The main reason for creating sequences inside the slip-box is to have an elaborated, well-articulated context for our ideas and thoughts.[^1]
