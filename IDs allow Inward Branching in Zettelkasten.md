[[Unique Card Identifiers in Zettelkasten]] allowed the creation of [[Folgezettel (pkm)]] through "internal branching"[^1][^3]. It's important to note that, in most cases, Luhmann's [[Folgezettel are myopic]] â€“ in practice, they had a primary link (the direct inward branch) and a set of secondary links. 

Additionally, these Folgezettels were the foundation of bottom-up topic creation[^2].
