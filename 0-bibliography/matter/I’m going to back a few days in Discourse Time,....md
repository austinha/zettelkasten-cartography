## Highlights
* the broader context is that America has really fallen on measures of trust. Our trust in government is extremely low, fragile-state low. Our trust in each other is higher, but falling. Our informational commons are fractured and angry. Policy lies downstream of society. Mandates are not self-executing; to work, policies need to be followed, guidance needs to be believed. Public health is rooted in the soil of trust. That soil has thinned in America.
* Once youâ€™re in as low-trust, high-dysfunction, high-polarization environment, all policy choices degrade.
* The Rogan problem is just a miniature version of our broad social problem here: The thing we need to be targeting is trust and persuasion. And policy is a very crude tool through which to do it.
