## Highlights
* One piece of clutter was the concept of Folgezettel.
* A Folgezettel is a child to his parent note. Simple as that. In the past, we’ve translated this German word as “sequence of notes”, which is how Luhmann came up with the concept.
* Luhmann, the godfather of the Zettelkasten Method himself, wrote that it is not important where you store a Zettel as long as you can reference it from every other point to the Zettelkasten.
* Daniel Lüdecke wrote that Luhmann relied heavily on the technique of Folgezettel and I think that he is right. But it doesn’t follow from Luhmann’s principles but rather came as a consequence of him having to deal with a physical Zettelkasten. It is accidental, not foundational for his success.
* A Folgezettel is a specific and intended connection between Zettels, realized through their position in the archive. You put a Zettel in a specific place and end up with a Folgezettel, which is nothing more than a connection between the preceding note and this new Zettel as a Folgezettel. This connection can intend several things: * continue a thought * add an idea to a thought * exclude a thought from the existing line of thoughts (Folgezettel could mark a blind end. That means it says what conclusion not to make.
* His register is truly just a map for his Zettelkasten to find a useful entrance. After entrying he’d get lost in it and go from connection to connection, sometimes via Folgezettel, sometimes via cross-references or links.
* Folgezettel create some kind of category. Similar principles are applied: You have one and only one connection to the level above.
* I am not entirely against categories. In fact, I find them quite useful. I use tags extensively because of that.
* Folgezettel are a technique to realize a principle. How you realize a principle, that is which technique you use, does not make any difference from a bird’s eye perspective.
* We have one and only one technique of direct and intended connection: We have links. We just insert a “§” with the ID of the Zettel we want to link to and there you have the link. * If I want to see all the children of a particular note (read: Folgezettel) I just search for its ID with a “§”-prefix. * If I want a Zettel to be an addition or a continuation of a Zettel I link to it and mark it as a continuation.
