## Highlights
* Some of his productivity can be a just a result of his work ethics. A Zettelkasten doesn’t make you a productivity maniac but only leverages your efforts.
* His readings triggered thoughts and these thoughts went into the Zettelkasten with distinct steps. * He created brief excerpts for a book and a list of thoughts with references to the pages in the book. * Later, he wrote every distinct point on a different Zettel and decided individually for every thought where to put it.
* The only criterion where to put a new Zettel: Connection to the previous Zettel. A Zettel should have some connection to the previous Zettel. The result: Some topics are spread out to different places.
* at the same time, you have different contexts because of the many places one topic is spread to. That gave Luhmann some variability which could enhance the possibility of making far fetches, therefore interesting connections. If you ditch the Folgezettel technique you’re going to loose this benefit.
* The interesting part for me was that the technique, not principle, of Folgezettel didn’t come up as important other than a method to find Zettel again.
* Luhmann stated the same thing: As long as you can find one Zettel, it doesn’t matter where you put it. You just have to be able to link to a Zettel and then you are fine.
* Folgezettel are not an important part of the method but rather a technique to cope with the physicality of his actual archive.
* There are some Zettel that just contained an extensive list of links to the core Zettels.
* Hubs are like highways between topics for the physical Zettelkasten.
* at the same time, you have different contexts because of the many places one topic is spread to. That gave Luhmann some variability which could enhance the possibility of making far fetches, therefore interesting connections. If you ditch the Folgezettel technique you’re going to loose this benefit. I extended my tool box with structural notes lately. This gives you the opportunity to safe the context without sacrificing the usability with Folgezettel.
