## Highlights
* if one has to write anyway, it is useful to take advantage of this activity in order to create in the system of notes a competent partner o communication.
* Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even
* Fixed numbers, abstracted from any content-based order relying on the entire structure has a number of advantages which, taken together, enable us to reach a higher type of order.
* 1. The possibility of arbitrary internal branching.
* A notecard with number 57/12 can then be continued with 57/13, etc. At the same time it can be supplemented at a certain word or thought by 57/12a or 57/12b, etc. Internally, this notecard can be complemented by 57/12a1, etc.
* On the page itself I use red letters or numbers in order to mark the place of connection.
* The disadvantage is that the originally continuous text is often broken up by hundreds of intermediate notecards. But if we systematically number the papers, we can find the original textual whole easily.
* Central concepts can have many links which show on which other contexts we can find materials relevant for them.
* Given this technique, it is less important where we place a new note.
* it is important to capture the connections radially, as it were, but at the same time also by right away recording back links in the notecards that are being linked to.
* 3. Register.
* Considering the absence of a systematic order, we must regulate the process of rediscovery of notes,
* Another complementary aid can be the bibliographical apparatus. Bibliographical notes which we extract from the literature, should be captured inside the card index.
* The second mind needs a number of years in order to reach critical mass. Until then, it functions as a mere container from which we can retrieve what we put in.
* exhibition. If, however, we seek communication with the second mind, we must seek internal possibilities for linkings which result in the unexpected (i.e. information).
* We could try to generalize the experiences of Paris, Florence, New York under general concepts like "art" or "exhibitions," or "crowding" (inter-actionistic), or "mass," or "freedom" or "education," in order to see how the second mind reacts.
* Usually it is more fruitful to look for formulations of problems that relate heterogeneous things with each other.
* In comparison with this structure, which offers possibilities of connection that can be actualized, the importance of what has actually been noted is secondary. Many of the notes will soon become unusable or cannot be used at a given occasion. This holds both for excerpts which are only useful in the case of especially remarkable formulations and for our own deliberations.
* Theoretical publications do therefore not result from simply copying what can already be found in the notebox.
* The communication with the second mind becomes fruitful only at a high level of generalization, namely that of establishing communicative relations of relations. And it becomes productive only at the moment of evaluation, and is thus bound to a certain time and is to a high degree accidental.
* The real problem thus becomes therefore one of producing accidents with sufficiently enhanced probabilities for selection.
* One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other. Only in the way can information be produced in the respective other.
* Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which possess a comparative schema—even
* For communication, we do not have to presuppose that both parties use the same comparative schema. The effect of surprise even increases when this is not the case and when we believe that a message means something (or is useful) against the background of other possibilities. Put differently, the variety in communicating systems increases when it may happen that the two partners successfully communicate in the face of different comparative goals.

  * **Note**: the more i learn about organization and Zettelkasten, the more i believe in the importance of surprise, as Luhmann (presciently and proactively) notes in this paper. here, he says that surprise is key to communication.
* Information is an intra-systematic event. It results when one compares one message or entry with regard to other possibilities. Information, accordingly, originates only in systems which
* we must choose either the rout of highly technical specialization or that of incorporating randomness and information generated ad hoc.
  * **Note**: the devil is in the details (though the details should be taken with a grain of salt when they’re coming from a possibly dubious translation) – ad hoc information generation is the result of a Zettelkasten: that is, information is created at the time of inspection, not necessarily in advance.
* I cannot answer this question deductively, not by means of a review of all the possibilities and the selection of the best. We shall remain at the bathos of experience and give only a description saturated by theory.
