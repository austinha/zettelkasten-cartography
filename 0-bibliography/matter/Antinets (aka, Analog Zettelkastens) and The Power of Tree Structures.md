## Highlights
* Luhmann's antinet (analog zettelkasten) was not of taxonomical nature. It was not centered on organizing information into a hierarchical structure for retrieval by the masses. It was not standardized.
* Schmidt calls Luhmann's antinet not an order of contents but a fixed order of positioning. It's not a system of random morphing structure zettels or maps of content.
* many of the structure zettels aim to be a home-base hub; something of an evergreen table of contents that require constant pruning.
