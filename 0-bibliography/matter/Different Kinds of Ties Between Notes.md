## Highlights
* Keywords are an indirect connection. They essentially decouple related notes from one another: none of my notes about “#banana” has to know about any other note on that topic. Still, they form a set or cluster.
* You can translate “Folgezettel” (literally: “subsequent note”) as “note sequence”.
* Folgezettel are child notes in the tree, not just every note that comes afterwards in a linearized view, which would include “2”.
* From the point of view of a single note, every note in its single sub-branch is a Folgezettel.
* According to Daniel (PDF link, at pp. 22, 37, & 41), the intention behind all this is to provide a story.
* Folgezettel carry a precise scope: you stop when you reach the sibling of your starting point.
