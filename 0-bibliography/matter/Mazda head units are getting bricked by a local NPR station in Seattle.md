## Highlights
* According to some Reddit users, the issue sounds even worse. Some owners reported losing Bluetooth connectivity and the ability to play CDs, as well as a disabled backup camera and powerless USB ports for charging phones. One user warned against disconnecting the carâ€™s 12-volt battery when troubleshooting, as you can lose the ability to even listen to KUOW. This all sounds like something that could have been fixed with a software update, but it turns out the solution is to replace the CMU, which is the $1,500 hardware computer component of the infotainment system.
