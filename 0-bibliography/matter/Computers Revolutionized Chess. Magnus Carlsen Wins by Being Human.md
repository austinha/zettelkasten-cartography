## Highlights
* Carlsen, 31, has weaponized the computer revolution against them. He does it not by overpowering opponents with calculation, but by harnessing that digital knowledge to turn games into more human battles.
* When players such as Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi have months to prepare for a world championship, they are armed with countless hours of study on this type of software. Based on the programs’ evaluations, they learn the optimal moves in the most probable situations. Carlsen knows all of these as well as—or better than—anyone on the planet. But he also possesses a mind so inventive that his best move is often not playing the best move. He would rather lead the game down a more obscure path where the player across the board might get lost.
* But here’s the twist: the most lethal use of computer-based analysis isn’t to find something that only the machine can see. It’s figuring out what it sees and dismisses that might still be useful.
