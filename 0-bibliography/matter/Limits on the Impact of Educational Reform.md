## Highlights
* At least in the United States, the primary impact of educational reform efforts on elementary and secondary schooling has been at the periphery rather than the core of this institution. These pressures from the social context have been able to exert a major impact on the rhetoric of education, and the most effective reform efforts have even been able to shape the formal structure of schooling; but they typically have had little impact on how teachers teach and even less on what students learn.
* pedagogical progressivism (John Dewey’s version) shaped the rhetoric of education but never penetrated the institutional practice of schooling,
* administrative progressivism (the version pursued by David Snedden and Elwood Cubberley) succeeding in changing rhetoric and in reshaping the formal structure of schooling, especially at the secondary level, but failed to extend much beyond this to shape the practice of teaching and learning in classrooms.
* U.S. reform movements in general have had more success changing the form of schooling rather than its instructional substance (loose coupling and weak administrative control), and I also explore some facets of the practice of teaching that make reforms at the classroom level potentially difficult anywhere in the world.
* “The Iron Law of Evaluation: The expected value of any net impact assessment of any social program is zero.”
* “The better designed the impact assessment of a social program, the more likely is the resulting estimate of net impact to be zero.”
* “The more social programs are designed to change individuals, the more likely the net impact of the program will be zero”
* this track record of failure and minimal impact is the result of the complexity of social institutions, which in turn makes it difficult to discern how they work, formulate valid plans for intervention, and successfully implement these plans.
* Education, after all, is an exercise in changing students in valued directions;
* Trying to mobilize all these actors to move in the same direction is enormously difficult, and Fullan devotes the latter part of his book to a discussion of how to accomplish this, both by building capacity for the actors to pursue change and by developing forms of accountability that will maintain pressure toward particular reform goals.
* the prospects for educational change vary according to the degree that reform efforts aim to transform the central functions of schooling.
* three levels in the educational system: policymakers, school administrators, and practitioners.
* most reforms get stalled at the door of the school administrator or the classroom teacher.
* From this angle, the challenge for reformers is to try to move reform down to the core levels of the system without letting it get blocked, deflected, or diluted.
  * **Note**: a lot of educational best practice brought forth by academics suffers the same fate: buzzwords encapsulate concepts that are only continually diluted as they spread
* At the top is the level of reform rhetoric.
* statements of principle, educational visions, rationales for change, frameworks for representing that change, and norms for reconstructed educational practice.
* most histories of reform are largely histories of reform rhetoric, saying little about the changes farther down in the system.
* Next is the level of formal structure.
* educational policies, organizational units, curriculum frameworks, classroom textbooks, and professional development workshops.
* Third is the level of classroom practice.
* At this level we arrive at the instructional core of the educational enterprise, and reform success depends entirely on the capability and willingness of 3 million American public school teachers in 95,000 schools (using the current U.S. numbers) to take on the reform agenda and put it into practice in their classrooms.
* the sheer number, diversity, and geographical dispersion of these teachers and classrooms suggests how difficult it is to effect reform at this level of the educational system.
* Last of all is the level of student learning.
* The key actors here are the students; and for reasons that I will explore at the end of this paper, they constitute a final barrier to reform that may be the most formidable, especially under the peculiar conditions of teaching and learning that characterize schools in the United States.
* Is the reform able to persuade educational opinion leaders at the rhetorical level, reshape the formal structure of schooling at the district level, remold the practice of teachers in individual classrooms, and reconstruct the learning of students in these classrooms?
* Initially an outgrowth of the political movement known as progressivism, the movement for progressive education emerged at the end of the 19th century in the U.S., became a major force in the first decade of the 20th century, and lasted for another 50 years.
* The reader will search these pages in vain for any capsule definition of progressive education. None exists, and none ever will; for throughout its history progressive education meant different things to different people…. (Cremin, 1961, p. x)
* Historians disagree about how to label the various tendencies within the movement.
* Herbert Kliebard (1986) identifies three, which he called social efficiency, child development, and social reconstruction.
* Robert Church and Michael Sedlak (1976) see two forms, which they call conservative and liberal.
* David Tyack (1974) calls these two tendencies administrative and pedagogical.
* Ellen Lagemann put the difference this way: I have often argued to students, only in part to be perverse, that one cannot understand the history of education in the United States during the twentieth century unless one realizes that Edward L. Thorndike won and John Dewey lost.
* If Dewey has been revered among some educators and his thought has had influence across a greater range of scholarly domains – philosophy, sociology, politics, and social psychology, among them – Thorndike’s thought has been more influential within education.
* If Dewey and the pedagogical progressives lost the fight for reshaping the structure of schools, they nonetheless exerted a major and continuing impact on the rhetoric of education.
* Thorndike and the administrative progressives managed to effect enduring changes in both rhetoric and the formal structure of schooling, but had a limited impact on the core of teaching and learning.
* they both shared a grounding in developmentalism. Both sought to establish a system of education that was designed around the needs and capabilities that students had at different stages of their intellectual and social development.
* the strongest link between them was their antagonism toward the traditional academic curriculum.
* The two strands of progressivism, however, took these two common orientations in very different directions.
* Pedagogical progressives saw developmentalism as a rationale for rejecting the traditional curriculum in favor of classroom processes that would harness individual student interests and abilities and would foster engaged, self-directed learning.
* they saw it as a conspiracy to impose adult mindsets and adult roles on children who needed the freedom to explore childhood and develop their own learning styles.
* curriculum. In their view, the ideal school would revolve around student initiative and student inquiry; focus on discovering knowledge instead of presenting knowledge; emphasize active and engaged learning over passive recitation of the text; organize study around projects, which drew on student interests and which synthesized knowledge and skill from multiple disciplines; and create a school as a democratic community, modeling values of justice and cooperation for later life.
* Administrative progressives eschewed the romanticism of their pedagogical counterparts in favor of a hard-headed utilitarianism.
* they tended to focus on school governance, professional administration, and scientifically designed formal curriculum.
* The two main principles of administrative progressive reforms were social efficiency and differentiation.
