## Highlights
* UPDATE (05/29/2020): The existing Folgezettel technique prescribed at niklas-luhmann-archiv.de (the primary source) has two seemingly unsolvable problems: the binary tree problem and the proximity problem. I’ve devised Note Sequence 2.0 in an attempt to improve it. In short, while I’ve advocated note sequences in this post, I figured it has become outmoded by the new technique. However, it still proved suboptimal for the Zettelkasten Method. And of course, I returned to the methods prescribed in zettelkasten.de.
* it doesn’t mean that you should only be exclusive to one method; they can actually be complementary.
* My priority of connecting new Zettels goes like this:
* 1. I look at the index.
* 2. I look at the tags.
* 3. Lastly, I search for keywords.
* it’s hard to visualize your thought trains in a UID-based system since it isn’t organized in any way.
* UID systems make it easy to go through direct links because all you have to do is click on them. It’s maximum flexibility. Folgezettel systems don’t have this advantage; you still have to manually search for the mentioned direct link before you can get to it.
* because Folgezettel is arranged alphanumerically, it makes thought trains easier to visualize;
* linking doesn’t end in the Folgezettel; rather, it shouldn’t.
* Folgezettel isn’t just about creating note sequences, it’s also about connecting one thought train to another.
* just to be clear, let me tell you that Folgezettel does not mean hierarchy.
* finally understood that it actually meant a direct, obvious connection between notes.
