## Highlights
* There are two aspects which are overseen here (which I also mention in my talk): 1. A Folgezettel or a note sequence was not primary used by Luhmann because of physical limitations of small paper where to write notes on. Writing very short notes is a technique itself. 2. A manual link or reference between two notes is, technically and regarding the context, something different than continuing an idea via Folgezettel (note sequences). Links or references do not emphasize the relationship between notes (ideas, content). The context of connections usually remains unclear due to arbitrary relationships. Folgezettel, however, create specific relationships – adding manual links (references) to these relationships create relationship of relationships, the core aspect of Luhmann’s working principle (which he describes as „Relationierung von Relationen“).
  * **Note**: it may be useful to determine what luhmann meant by relationship of relationships: here, it is used to argue that the first “relationship” in the term is a Folgezettel and the second is a link within the sequence.
* it seems that the first element – the root – defines a specific category. But, all notes in a note sequence are on the same level. There are no categories.
