## Highlights
* controlled vocabulary. These types of taxonomies center on a specific list of words for a specified subject matter.
* hierarchical taxonomy. These taxonomies are structured in such a way wherein the subject matter is broken apart into categories and subcategories. The format is Broad category → specific subcategory → even more specific subcategory.
* This can be confusing for some because Notecard IDs are of a nature comprised of dashes (e.g. /). The dashes seem to indicate the items following it are somehow lower on a hierarchical position. Yet this is not the case. The position of any note reveals nothing about its theoretical importance. There exist no privileged positions in the web of notes.
  * **Note**: this is what people mean when they say “flat hierarchy”
