## Highlights
* When Facebook moved this week to make it harder for people to volunteer their own News Feed data to an external research program, it signaled that this is the way it is heading. But what if it did the reverse? What if it invested dramatically more in research, and publicly pressured its peers to join it? What if Facebook routinely published its findings and allowed its data to be audited? What if the company made it dramatically easier for qualified researchers to study the platform independently? This would be unprecedented in the history of American business, but Facebook is an unprecedented thing in the world. The company canâ€™t rebuild trust with the larger world through blog posts and tweet storms. But it could start by helping us understand its effects on human behavior, politics, and society.
