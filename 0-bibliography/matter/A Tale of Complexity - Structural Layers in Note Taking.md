## Highlights
* They look much like a table of contents. Itâ€™s because they are tables of contents. A table of contents is a structured set of chapters of a book, a set with hierarchy and order.
* A sign of not dealing with structural layers are project folders, and folders in general.
* Structure notes share a similarity to tags: Both point to sets of notes. Structure notes just add another element. They are sets with added structure.
* The structure note is tagged with a special tag: ##self-worth. If I search for #self-worth (note the single hash!) I get all the notes that deal with this concept but with a double hash I go directly where the money is in my archive: The top-level structure note.
