## Highlights
* I just my graph mostly to make sure I haven’t messed up my organizational system.
* I often notice sync errors on the graph first, because they manifest as duplication errors, which means extra notes show up in places I might not think to look if I wasn’t getting a “top-down” visual view of my whole vault.
* The graph view also gives me a sense of how I can flow from section to section
* I’ve found — to my surprise, honestly — that my graph view gives me genuine insights about how my knowledge work integrates, and where I should focus my time.
* For my articles, I have a lot of work in progress articles that are not well linked up — they’re just sitting there in a little sun, and that tells me that whatever that concept was, it probably needs some more work to develop it. Whereas, if something in that section is messy and interconnected, I know that it’s probably built out a little more and is ready to go if I need to write something for a deadline.
* when I’m reviewing my graph, I like to zoom in on a node, and just kind of float my mouse around different things to see if there’s something that I could be inspired by that I haven’t used… but might be useful.
