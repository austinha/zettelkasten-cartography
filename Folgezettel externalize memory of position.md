> Luhmann created order with his Folgezettel to force each Zettel into an unchanging position: Once it is placed, it could not be moved. He externalized the memorization of each position of the Zettel to the system: If each Zettel has an unchanging position, you can refer to it. But you would not have to recall the individual number. You combine entry points (that’s what his register is for) with associations within the Zettelkasten.[^1]

this claim, i think, is controversial but insightful. one problem that physical Zettelkasten solve is the externalization of where to find information. that said, i think some would claim that you must also take into account the role of serendipity in the effectiveness of physical Zettelkasten – when there is some randomness in a system, it can make it more likely that unanticipated connections are made.
