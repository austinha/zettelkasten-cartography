# Foundations of Luhmann's Zettelkasten

[[Luhmann's Slip Box]] allowed him to be a prolific writer and researcher. Fundamentally, basic rules at the atomic level of the Zettelkasten allowed an emergent structure to form and allowed him to develop lines of thinking that could be further developed into papers. Luhmann stated that his Zettelkasten was his communication partner and that its structure was part of the reason it could be a "second mind."
