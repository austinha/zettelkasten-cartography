Before moving on, it's worthwhile to note that the language of "mapping" out the knowledge in a Zettelkasten is already common[^8][^9]. I think that the idea of mapping out knowledge is more apt (and useful) than we might have initially realized. If there is a Topography of Knowledge in our Zettelkasten, then we must move around that Topography and selectively map out the _information_[^11] those connections contain[^10] for our purposes; our existing Zettelkasten is the map that we are constructing of the knowledge in the Perfect Zettelkasten.

Knowing this, in our mapping process, we are acting as cartographers. As such, I propose we can use cartographical language when discussing our ZK:
[[The Fundamental Objectives of Traditional Cartography]]
- **For ZK "map editing"**: We must select the traits we are interested in mapping. Of course, as sascha notes[^13], anything _can_ be related to anything else, but it is our selection of interesting traits that makes our Zettelkasten useful to us based on the "comparative schema"[^11] we bring to the slip-box at any given time. I suggest our filter is simply "features/connetions we're interested in"[^15], which again seems trivial to state.
- **For ZK "generalization"**: We act upon the traits we've chosen in the "map editing" phase and only comparatively file[^10] our notes selectively, not blindly (which is why it's different than a wiki![^16]). We must also work to reduce the complexity of the things we _do_ map (and we do this by choosing key feautures to focus on like topics, projects, curiosity, etc.)

The above are the foundation of ZK exploration – it is the process of radial branching[^12] through comparative filing[^10] where we reduce complexity by choosing simplifying assumptions that filter the connections we map, thereby making our Zettelkasten unique and useful to *us*. This manifests in the selection of what to read, how we read, how we take notes, and how we comparatively file.

The following are actually more controversial at the moment:
- **For ZK "map design"**: _This_ is the heart of the great Folgezettel debate. The question is: how do we orchestrate all of the elements above (the selected connections to be mapped) in a way that allows the zettelkasten to serve as a "thought partner"[^11]? So far, the most popular methods of achieving this have been through Folgezettel (or Folgezettel-like structures) and Structure Notes.
- **For ZK "map projection"**: Part of map design, deciding how to project our Topology onto a 2D space (our editors) is what I see as the _missing key_ to the Folgezettel debate. It has been most vigorously alluded to by those who have been the largest advocates for Folgezettel, such as @pseudovagrius and @argonsnorts, but I don't know of anywhere that has explicitly stated that the community should discuss _how_ we see and traverse our knowledge topology.
