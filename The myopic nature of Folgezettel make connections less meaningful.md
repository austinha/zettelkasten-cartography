sfast claims that since [[Folgezettel are myopic]], they end up losing meaning – this, however, is _by design_:
> It is _difficult_ to make associations explicit and even more difficult to make those associations meaningful because they are inherently not. This is not how associations work. _The more creative they are the **less** meaningful they are from a very early threshold._ Meaning is maximised when you find the right "distance" of association.[^1]
