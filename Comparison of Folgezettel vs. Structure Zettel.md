# Comparative filing
Folgezettel force **LOCAL **comparative filing 
 + - + non-semantic relationships encoded 
 |  
 + - + creation of decentralized structure 
 |  
 + -------> postponement of the articulation of meaning 

Structure Zettel allow comparative filing but emphasize **broader views**.
- centralized hierarchy and structure
- semantic relationships
+ ---→ immediate, explicit, and "tangible"[^1] thought trains expressed as "meaningful hierarchy"[^1]

[[{1,1,1,1 } Meaningless Folgezettel hierarchies can be useful]]
[[{1,3,4,2 } Structure Zettels' centralization requires maintenance]]
- the nexus of opposed hierarchies is a single note.
    - this manifests in folgezettel through discovery – these opposed hierarchies are not artiulated but surfed
    - this manifests in structure zettel through a single note's placement in multiple hierarchies (and thus browsing backlinks)

if these methods are functionally equivalent (in the strictest sense), looking at their use (and what use cases they encourage) might be helpful to determine why there's so much consternation over which is "better."
- my intuition says that the difference _is_ that one view is nearsighted and the other is farsighted. 
- my sense is that if you're always taking the farsighted view, you have fewer chances of being surprised by your slip box. this is yet to be proven. (see pseudovagrius' idea of "uncovering"[^2])
- Luhmann supports this in his paper when he says: "we must choose either the rout of highly technical specialization or that of incorporating randomness and information generated ad hoc"[^3] – that _not_ knowing something about how your archive is structured is part of its usefulness.

[[Topography of knowledge in Zettelkasten]]

## Claim: Structure Zettel encode more information about note connectivity.
we can look at establishing a basis for determining the usefulness of each method by first comparing them and determining where they differ, since they are functionally the same: 

you might contend that since structure notes are a strict superset of the behavior of folgezettel that they must have different topography. i would say that their topography, semantically, must be a superset of the topography of folgezettel. 

it's similar to the way that multidimendional spaces can always capture a superset of the spaces that have fewer dimensions than it (a 3D space allows all 2D figures but not vice versa; a square can exist in a 3D space, so can a circle – a cube cannot exist in a 2D space). 

this follows the geometric analogy well because we are dealing with topography – it can be if we lose the ability to change some variable, then it must exist in a smaller space than its parent. in folgezettel, that dimension is the semantic encoding of connections that structure zettel allow.

in other words, the topography of structure zettel must _allow_ more complexity than that of a folgezettel. does this occur? according to @sfast, yes (and i think i agree). sascha consistently affirms that Structure Zettel encode meaningful hierarchies in the context of a given structure zettel – and argonsnorts agrees[^4]. these agreements are enough for us to conclude that the structure zettel topography is more complex! since both structures remove meaning from the hierarchy across the entire  (the primary feature of zettelkasten, via the principle of radial branching)[^5], both can be used "to navigate and uncover multiple and often opposed hierarchies at once."[^2] (it's just that they are done in different ways – this will be addressed later). this means that the complexity of a structure zettel-based zettelkasten must be at least as much as a folgezettel-based one. finally, we know that structure zettel also allow different kinds of encodings through annotation. this is even something that @sfast advocates for[^6]. This added dimension of metadata is not inherent in most implementations of zettelkasten. as such, this changes the way an archive is traversed and structured, and especially has impacts for _how_ you choose to traverse the archive.

again, we started with the assumption that these archives are (in theory) **functionally** the same – that is, they can achieve the same state of note connectivity. since we have now established this, that means they must be **aesthetically** different. at least, this assertion falls in line with the evidence we've seen thus far.



aside: luhmann's zettelkasten can be reduced to a single large structure note
